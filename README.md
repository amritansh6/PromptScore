# Prompt Score

## Overview
This project offers a suite of tools designed for evaluating and fine-tuning LLama models in the context of prompt scoring. It features scripts for adding base prompts with constraints to a database, fine-tuning models, generating performance graphs, and performing detailed comparisons between models. The code requires API keys which can be added to the keys.py file. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Python website:

[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation
To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
# Navigate to the project directory
cd [project-directory]
```

## Usage

### Adding Base Prompts
To add a new base prompt and append constraints which are then stored in the database for evaluation:

```bash
python3 PromptScore.py
```

### Fine-Tuning LLama
To initiate the training process and fine-tune the LLama model for evaluating the prompt score:

```bash
python3 PromptScore_Llama.py
```

### Generating Performance Graphs
Graphs for each model can be generated by running individual scripts located in the `/llms` directory:

```bash
python3 /llms/file_name.py
```
Replace `file_name.py` with the actual script name you intend to run.

### Model Comparison
For comparing multiple models based on specified criteria:

```bash
python3 compare.py
```
